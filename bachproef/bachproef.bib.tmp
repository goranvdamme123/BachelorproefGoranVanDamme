abstract = {Contemporary industrial control systems no longer operate in isolation, but use other networks (e.g., corporate networks and the Internet) to facilitate and improve business processes. The consequence of this development is the increased exposure to cyber threats. This paper surveys the latest methodologies and research for measuring and managing this risk. A dearth of industrial-control-system-specific security metrics has been identified as a barrier to implementing these methodologies. Consequently, an agenda for future research on industrial control system security metrics is outlined. The “functional assurance” concept is also introduced to deal with fail-safe and fail-secure industrial control system operations.}

  volume   = {103},
  abstract = {Network segmentation or compartmentalization, and layered protection are two strategies that are critical in building a secure network. In the literature, layered protection has been formalized and termed as the Defence in Depth (DD) strategy. However, network segmentation has been described vaguely, and without any formal approach, thus making the secure design of large networks unwieldy. In this paper, we formally define network segmentation using a formalism based on product family algebra and guarded commands. Then we propose two algorithms that take a set of resources and their access control policies as input and output a robust network topology and the policies of its firewalls. The firewall policies are computed based on the network segmentation formalism and are strategically placed in the network to achieve DD. Further, we use the proposed algorithms to build Software Defined Networks (SDN) and discuss its use in dynamic networks and Internet of Things.},
